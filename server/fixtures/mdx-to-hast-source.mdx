    We provide pre-built Docker images for every version of Teleport.

    These images are hosted on Amazon ECR Public. All tags under
    `public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport`
    [are Teleport Open Source images](https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport).

    <Admonition
      type="warning"
      title="Quay Docker Images"
    >
      Docker images will continue to be published to quay.io until Teleport 10 is EOL.
    </Admonition>

    The table below gives an idea of how our image naming scheme works. We offer
    images that point to a static version of Teleport as well as images that are
    automatically rebuilt every night. These nightly images point to the latest
    version of Teleport from the three most recent release branches. They are
    stable, and we recommend their use to keep your Teleport installation up to
    date.
